# “Proxy ME – Who can substitute me?”
# Motivation: 
The issue of time and availability is paramount to individual as well as to organization. We aim to fulfill the necessities, by reducing the extra time and money expenditure with a proxy mechanism in place. Optimization of the effort and time can be achieved by putting the “Proxy ME” application where an individual or a group can define priorities, assign and drive their tasks to completion.
# Approach:
The unique system which is designed for users who are seeking assistance from others to attend or be present at some professional/personal events. In a routine, people have lot of tasks to do at the same time. They might not be able to be present at all places physically.
The Application serves to solve this problem by bringing the unique minds together to contribute to the society. Based on the necessity and the availabilities, the experts can attend the customer as a proxy person and solve the problem. There will be web based and mobile application (future enhancement) where the ingenious minds sharing the same interest can help their peers by being the proxy person when the resource pool with desired expertise is not available. The people registered will be rated as per the profile and the experience hence displaying their performance. The organization or an individual based on the rating would hire the proxy person to solve the particular problem.
